# private-projects-portfolio

Some of my more advanced or experimental projects don’t appear on my public GitHub.
Most of them are still in early research, draft form, or evolving ideas — and publishing them too soon would add noise instead of value.

This repo exists just to show **what I’m working on privately**, without exposing unfinished code or half-baked prototypes.

It’s not a “secret portfolio.”
It’s simply a place to keep track of ongoing work as it matures.

## What I’m Working On

I group things by theme instead of listing individual repos.
Projects shift, merge, or get rewritten over time, so this format reflects how I actually work.

### Statistical Modeling + Neural Networks

Experiments combining classical and modern modeling:

* extending hierarchical models (HLM³) into neural architectures,
* testing nonlinear transformations as activation strategies,
* comparing GLM interpretability with deep learning approaches,
* building multilevel neural designs for structured datasets.

This expands on research I started years ago and keep revisiting.



### Architectures Inspired by Real Systems

Prototypes based on problems I’ve seen in practical environments:

* LLM agents with restricted or rule-based actions,
* permission and policy layers for model operations,
* observability and monitoring patterns,
* scalable ingestion and preprocessing pipelines.

They stay private mainly because they simulate enterprise-like setups and need proper context.



### Experimental / Sandbox Work

A space for unusual or exploratory ideas:

* Explainable neural networks and AI frameworks for educational purposes,
* quantum-inspired experiments,
* minimalistic or retro AI frameworks,
* early multi-agent environment designs.

Some become usable prototypes; others remain thought experiments.

## Upcoming Private Projects (In Progress)

Some of the first private repositories that will reach a stable and presentable state are listed below.
They are currently under active development and remain private to allow proper maturation, validation, and documentation.

Once completed, they can be shared **selectively and with proper context**, as each project addresses a different technical and research dimension.

### 1) hybrid-r-python-ml-system

*(R and Python versions)*

This project is a **full, end-to-end applied case study** designed to demonstrate competencies in:

* data engineering,
* statistical modeling,
* and integration with Large Language Models (LLMs).

The core idea is to **revisit and operationalize concepts from my undergraduate thesis**, which focused on Walmart weekly sales prediction using statistical and multilevel models, and extend them into a **practical application layer**, including an API-oriented design.

Two parallel implementations are planned:

* **R version** — emphasizing statistical rigor, diagnostics, and reproducibility.
* **Python version** — focusing on interoperability, pipelines, and extensibility.

This repository is inspired by real enterprise data & AI scenarios and is intended as a structured technical exercise rather than a production system.



### 2) rag-statistical-model-explainer/

This project explores the intersection between **statistical modeling and LLM-based systems**.

The goal is to build an intelligent system using **LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** that can:

* read outputs from statistical models (Linear Regression, GLM, HLM3),
* interpret coefficients, diagnostics, and assumptions,
* and generate structured, human-readable explanations.

Rather than replacing statistical reasoning, the system is designed to **augment interpretation**, acting as an explanatory layer on top of classical models.

This work sits at the boundary between:

* statistical inference,
* explainability,
* and applied LLM systems.



### 3) java-agents/


This repository will focus on **agent-based architectures implemented in Java**.

The emphasis will be on:

* agent orchestration,
* controlled action execution,
* integration with LLMs,
* and clean, enterprise-oriented architectural design.

## Access

If you’re reviewing my work for:

* a technical interview,
* research discussions,
* collaboration,
* or mentorship,

I can share:

* read-only access to selected private repos,
* architecture explanations,
* walkthroughs,
* or concise technical summaries.

Each project is at a different stage, so I prefer sharing them with context rather than publishing everything publicly.

---

## Final Note

This repo **does not contain source code**.
It just explains why certain projects aren’t public and gives a high-level view of what I’m currently researching.

If anything here interests you, feel free to reach out.

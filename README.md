# private-projects-portfolio

Some of my more advanced or experimental projects don’t appear on my public GitHub.
Most of them are still in early research, draft form, or evolving ideas — and publishing them too soon would add noise instead of value.

This repo exists just to show **what I’m working on privately**, without exposing unfinished code or half-baked prototypes.

It’s not a “secret portfolio.”
It’s simply a place to keep track of ongoing work as it matures.

## What I’m Working On

I group things by theme instead of listing individual repos.
Projects shift, merge, or get rewritten over time, so this format reflects how I actually work.

### Statistical Modeling + Neural Networks

Experiments combining classical and modern modeling:

* extending hierarchical models (HLM³) into neural architectures,
* testing nonlinear transformations as activation strategies,
* comparing GLM interpretability with deep learning approaches,
* building multilevel neural designs for structured datasets.

This expands on research I started years ago and keep revisiting.



### Architectures Inspired by Real Systems

Prototypes based on problems I’ve seen in practical environments:

* LLM agents with restricted or rule-based actions,
* permission and policy layers for model operations,
* observability and monitoring patterns,
* scalable ingestion and preprocessing pipelines.

They stay private mainly because they simulate enterprise-like setups and need proper context.



### Experimental / Sandbox Work

A space for unusual or exploratory ideas:

* small neural engines written in Pascal,
* quantum-inspired experiments,
* minimalistic or retro AI frameworks,
* early multi-agent environment designs.

Some become usable prototypes; others remain thought experiments.

## Access

If you’re reviewing my work for:

* a technical interview,
* research discussions,
* collaboration,
* or mentorship,

I can share:

* read-only access to selected private repos,
* architecture explanations,
* walkthroughs,
* or concise technical summaries.

Each project is at a different stage, so I prefer sharing them with context rather than publishing everything publicly.

## Final Note

This repo **does not contain source code**.
It just explains why certain projects aren’t public and gives a high-level view of what I’m currently researching.

If anything here interests you, feel free to reach out.

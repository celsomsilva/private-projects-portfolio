# private-projects-portfolio – Context and Overview

Some people notice that several of my more advanced or technical projects don’t appear publicly on my GitHub.
The reason is simple: **a good portion of what I’m working on right now is still in research, draft, or exploratory form**, and publishing it too early would create more confusion than clarity.

This repository exists just to give **visibility into what I’m actively building and studying behind the scenes**, without exposing unfinished or context-dependent code.

It’s not a “hidden portfolio” — it’s just a way to keep track of ongoing work while it evolves.

## What I’m Working On (Grouped by Theme)

Instead of listing individual repositories, I prefer to organize things by area of investigation.
This also gives me flexibility as projects grow, merge, or change direction.


### Statistical Modeling and Neural Networks

Experiments connecting ideas from classical modeling with deep learning, such as:

* hierarchical structures (HLM³) combined with neural architectures,
* nonlinear transformations tested as activation mechanisms,
* interpretability comparisons between GLM approaches and neural networks,
* multilevel neural designs for structured datasets.

This work extends the research I started years ago and continues to develop.


### Architectures Inspired by Real Enterprise Scenarios

These prototypes aren’t polished, but they help me explore how I would design or evaluate systems in practical environments:

* action-restricted or rule-based LLM agents,
* permission layers for model execution,
* monitoring and observability tooling,
* scalable data ingestion and processing flows.

They stay private mostly to avoid misinterpretation, since they simulate (not replicate) real-world setups.

### Experimental / Sandbox Projects

This is where I test unconventional or just-for-fun ideas:

* small neural engines implemented in Pascal,
* quantum-inspired research toys,
* retro or minimalistic AI frameworks,
* multi-agent environment skeletons.

Some evolve into working prototypes; others remain exploratory notes.

## Access to the Projects

If you’re evaluating my work for:

* a technical interview,
* research collaboration,
* mentorship,
* or you simply want a deep dive into any of these directions,

I can provide:

* read-only access to specific private repositories,
* architectural explanations,
* guided walkthroughs,
* or technical summaries.

I prefer to share context individually because each project is at a different stage and requires explanation.

## Final Note

This repository **does not contain source code**.
It’s only meant to clarify why certain important or ongoing projects don’t appear publicly and to give a high-level sense of what I’m researching at the moment.

If something here catches your interest, feel free to reach out.
